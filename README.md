Datasheets:

- [Tracker SoM](https://docs.particle.io/datasheets/asset-tracking/tracker-som-datasheet/)
- [Tracker SoM Evaluation Board](https://docs.particle.io/datasheets/asset-tracking/tracker-som-eval-board/)
- [Tracker One](https://docs.particle.io/datasheets/asset-tracking/tracker-one/)


In this repository you can find the following directories:

- eagle-eval: The Tracker SoM evaluation board
- eagle-carrier: The Tracker carrier board (the board in the Tracker One)

Within the Eagle directories are the standard Eagle files:

- *.sch Schematic file
- *.sch.pdf PDF version of the schematic (handy if you don't have Eagle CAD)
- *.brd Board Layout file
- *.lbr Library containing all of the components in the sch/brd files
- *.rar or *.zip Gerber files
- *.cam CAM file used to produce the Gerber file

The boards are identical for both Tracker SoM versions (T402 and T523).
